## About

You space is a content management that can connect with others sources of videos and centralize all they in just one place.

The ideia of you-space is centralize the content of one creator and give him a more freedom way to interact with his public.

The CMS do not replace others platforms but use they as a source of content, youtube videos for example will still be in youtube server, but they will be accessible in your you-space instance and will have some internal personalization too.

You can also upload some videos in the local you-space instance too and mix they with the normal youtube videos if you want.
